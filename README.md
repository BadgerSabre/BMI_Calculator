# BMI_Calculator

I created this simple desktop app to get practice using Windows Forms using .Net Core 3.1

The user can simply input their height, weight and age(in either imperial or metric) to find their BMI

To install to desktop simply click on the release and download the .zip file.  Then double click the "BMI_Calculator.exe" to run.
